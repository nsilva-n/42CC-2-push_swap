# push_swap

*Oh daring coder, take up the mantle of algorithmic mastery and conquer the challenge of sorting stacks with elegance and efficiency!*

Within this repository lies **push_swap**, a project designed to test your ability to devise and implement sorting algorithms with limited resources and operations.

## Prelude

*Oh valiant tactician, enter the realm of `push_swap`!* 

This project challenges you to sort data using two stacks and a predefined set of operations. You must navigate the complexities of algorithm design, efficiency, and minimalism to achieve victory.

## The Quest

*Embark, O wise coder, on this strategic endeavor!*

Your mission is to sort a stack of integers using the following rules:
- You are provided with two stacks, `A` and `B`.
- You can only use a predefined set of operations (explained below).
- Your goal is to sort stack `A` in ascending order with the fewest operations possible.

This project is a test of your algorithmic ingenuity, requiring you to balance efficiency and correctness.

## Features

*Marvel at the capabilities of push_swap:*
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implement custom sorting strategies to minimize operations.
- **Stack Management**: Efficiently manipulate two stacks to achieve the desired order.
- **Predefined Operations**: Use a limited set of operations to solve the problem.
- **Performance Optimization**: Strive to reduce the number of operations for large datasets.

## Requirements

*To succeed, equip yourself with these tools:*

- **Compiler**: GCC or Clang.
- **Libraries**: Standard C library (`<unistd.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, `<stdio.h>`).
- **Makefile**: Automate your build process with targets `all`, `clean`, `fclean`, and `re`.

## Getting Started

*Prepare your arsenal and set forth on your quest!*
Clone this repository and navigate to the `push_swap` directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nsilva-n/42CC-2-push_swap.git
cd 42CC-2-push_swap
make
```

Run your program with:
```bash
./push_swap <list_of_integers>
```

Example:
```bash
./push_swap 4 3 2 1
```

## Operations

*With these operations, command the stacks to obey your will:*

| Operation | Description                               |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|
| `sa`      | Swap the first two elements of stack `A`. |
| `sb`      | Swap the first two elements of stack `B`. |
| `ss`      | Perform `sa` and `sb` simultaneously.     |
| `pa`      | Push the top element of stack `B` onto `A`.|
| `pb`      | Push the top element of stack `A` onto `B`.|
| `ra`      | Rotate stack `A` up by one position.      |
| `rb`      | Rotate stack `B` up by one position.      |
| `rr`      | Perform `ra` and `rb` simultaneously.     |
| `rra`     | Reverse rotate stack `A` by one position. |
| `rrb`     | Reverse rotate stack `B` by one position. |
| `rrr`     | Perform `rra` and `rrb` simultaneously.   |

*Master these operations to achieve victory!*

## Algorithmic Strategy

*Plan thy moves with the wisdom of a grandmaster:*

The key to success in `push_swap` lies in designing an efficient sorting algorithm. Consider the following strategies:
- **Small Datasets**: Use simple algorithms like bubble sort or insertion sort.
- **Large Datasets**: Implement advanced algorithms like quicksort or mergesort, adapted for two stacks.
- **Optimal Moves**: Minimize the number of operations by carefully planning each step.

Experiment with different approaches and analyze their performance to find the most efficient solution.

## Testing

*Test thy creation to ensure its strength and precision:*

Create your own test scenarios to ensure correctness and efficiency. For example:
```bash
./push_swap 3 2 5 1 4
```
